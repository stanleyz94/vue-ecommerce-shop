# Polish IKEA website clone created with Vue 3, Vuex and TailwindCSS



## About




The idea of this project was to train how to build simple e-commerce shop by using Vue a front end JavaScript framework, TailwindCSS a CSS framework to create css structure based on predefined design which is on official website of IKEA. This application also uses Vuex which provides a centralized storage data for the whole application

Application shows a list of wardrobes, which can be filtered/sorted and added to the cart shop. The information on this project is static and is not coming from an API.


**This is not a full clone of the IKEA website, application contains only small part of the IKEA website which is wardrobe section and not all functions are working.
